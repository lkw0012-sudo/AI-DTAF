## Troubleshooting 
If the AI doesn't generate exactly what you need: - Try the prompt again (sometimes results vary) - Ask for specific corrections (e.g., "fix the DS category colors" or "adjust the mobile layout") - Request modifications (e.g., "make the capability blocks larger" or "add more spacing") - Ask for specific capability corrections if any are missing or incorrect 
This generates the clean, static base periodic table that shows the complete Digital Twin 
capability framework in a professional format that works across all major AI assistants and 
aligns with the Digital Twin Consortium's official documentation. ---
